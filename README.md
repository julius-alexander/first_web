This is an experimental project focused on learning the basics of Git (and GitHub) as well as React.
This was done by following a tutorial from The Net Ninja titled "Full React Tutorial" on YouTube.
I made several changes to the design, in an effort to make it a more polished experience (styles, formatting, etc.)
I used Git commands such as 'clone', 'add', 'commit', and 'push' after reaching small milestones in order to better understand the importance of version control.
In the future, I expect to work more with commands involving branching, merging, pull, etc.
